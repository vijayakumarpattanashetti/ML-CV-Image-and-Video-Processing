# ML-CV-Image-and-Video-Processing

This repo includes the basic exercises on ML, Image &amp; Video Processing, and Computer Vision using Python 3 & its packages (OpenCV, Numpy, Tensorflow, Keras, Matplotlib).<br>
The exercises done here are for my learning, practice, understanding and experimenting.


Experiments:

Image Processing and Computer Vision

01. Basic Image Pre-processing Techniques using OpenCV
02. Face Detection using Haar Cascade Features
03. Fruit Classifier based on texture and color using Binary Trees from sklearn
04. Image Classification on MNIST fashion dataset using tensorflow, keras
05. Using webcam to take a pic and save using OpenCV
06. Tracking Red color and marking in the livestream using OpenCV
07. Image Enhancement using Histogram Equilization
08. Gamma Correction on an Image
09. Optical Character Recognition
10. Manual ROI using Cursor
11. Image Resizing
12. Image Segmentation
13. Interactive GraphCut Segmentation

Video Processing (mp4 and livestream)

14. Background Subtraction to detect motion
15. Face and Eyes Detection based on Haar Cascad Features
16. Sobel Edge Detection
17. Canny Edge Detection
18. Blob Detection
19. CAMShift Tracking

Language: Python 3
Python Version: 3.7
Spyder version: 4.1.2
Additional Packages to be installed: opencv, tensorflow, keras
*Note: Anaconda comes with numpy(in-built)

Instructions:

1. Download Anaconda on their official website (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
2. To install any new packages close anaconda entirely, and open anaconda command prompt to install via command as shown below:
     conda install -channel conda-forge <package/s> (eg., conda install -c conda-forge opencv)
    Note: Do update anaconda before installing packages, if required.
